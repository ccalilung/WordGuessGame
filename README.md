# WordGuessGame
Deployed project on GitHub: https://ccalilung.github.io/WordGuessGame

Background: Using a keyboard listener method from JavaScript, the player of the game should be able to guess letters against stored words in a game of hangman. Variables were set to determine how many guesses a player has remaining, as well correct letters left and incorrect letters guessed. Additionally, another functionality was added to prevent duplicate letters from being added to the incorrect or correct letters array, so that a player wouldn't be awarded for a duplicate correct letter guess or penalized for guessing an already guessed incorrect letter. Wins and Losses are also recorded after each round is completed, and a message appears at the end based on how the player did.

Instructions: The game is hangman. Type any letter to guess a letter. Correct guesses will result in the letter appearing in its proper place in the word. Correct guesses do not count against the "Guesses Left." Incorrect guesses will appear below the hidden word. These will reduce the number of guesses you have left.

If you correctly guess the letters of the word without running out of guesses, you win the round and it is recorded. Conversely, if you run out of guesses before guessing the word correctly, you lose the round and it is recorded. In both these cases, the game resets and a new word appears. The game ends once you've run out of words to guess.
