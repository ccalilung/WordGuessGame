# WordGuessGame
The game is hangman. Type any letter to guess a letter. Correct guesses will result in the letter appearing in its proper place in the word. Correct guesses do not count against the "Guesses Left." Incorrect guesses will appear below the hidden word. These will reduce the number of guesses you have left.

If you correctly guess the letters of the word without running out of guesses, you win the round and it is recorded. Conversely, if you run out of guesses before guessing the word correctly, you lose the round and it is recorded. In both these cases, the game resets and a new word appears. The game ends once you've run out of words to guess.
